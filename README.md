# smartpropertygrid-net6-samples

This repository contains 2 sample apps that allow you to play with the capabilities of the [Smart PropertyGrid for .Net 6](https://visualhint.com/propertygrid) library.

Note that **Smart PropertyGrid** trial version will soon be available on nuget.org. For customers, it is downloadable from a private NuGet feed.

The [documentation](https://docs.visualhint.com/spg) can be found on the VisualHint web site.

## Quickstart

This sample code is to be used along the last section of the documentation.

## PropertyGridShowRoom

This sample code uses 2 PropertyGrids to showcase what it's possible to do when filling a grid manually. All of the features you see can of course be achieved when using SelectedObject, only in a different manner.
